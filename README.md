Antique Gas Pumps, Really interested in image management with cms on website, currently have a website done by website company and they used Roots for image management. It is very good, but also very basic and no longer supported. It may be the way it was implemented, but very little control over images: no way to add alt text, hyperlinks or effects such as enlarge on hover.
